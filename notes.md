Current about me:

Hi! My name's John, aka burntcustard. I’m a <b>web developer</b> at <a href="https://wearelighthouse.com/">Lighthouse London</a>, and a <b>Computer Science (Games)</b> graduate. When I'm not at work, I'm usually playing video games, building PCs, or wondering around catching Pokémon.

New about me: (if it gets too long needs to be separate still?)

New plan...
Very yellow.
No categories, just top 5 things?
1. Title and short intro still
2. Savoir - in pretende browser - right?
3. StemCSS (?) - in pretende code editor that's animated mmm - left?
4. CodeHeadings - Actual codeheadings somehow but yellow text - right?
5. Canvasnake - center because slidey out bits
6. Games or TNT? something else? left
7. Footer/contacty so doesn't count as a thing

New new plan... (might move to 2019 update branch)

1. Title & short intro (while other stuff in the background loads)
2. Yes, multiple pages (could be all same page w/ clever JS):
  1. Sites / work / Lighthouse
    1. Propio
    2. Savoir
    3. BetterBankside (soon)
    4. Lighthouse Website (soon)
    5. StemCSS
    ... just choose 4 of those mebbe?
  2. Personal Web Projects / Games / Apps etc.
    1. canvasnake
    2. scrabble (hopefully react soon)
    3. codeheadings
  3. Video games screenshots / gallery
3. Footer or links page or in header?
