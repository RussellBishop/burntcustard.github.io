New plan...
Very yellow.
No categories, just top 5 things?
1. Title and short intro still
2. Savoir - in pretende browser - right?
3. StemCSS (?) - in pretende code editor that's animated mmm - left?
4. CodeHeadings - Actual codeheadings somehow but yellow text - right?
5. Canvasnake - center because slidey out bits
6. Games or TNT? something else? left
7. Footer/contacty so doesn't count as a thing

New new plan... (might move to 2019 update branch)

1. Title & short intro (while other stuff in the background loads)

  1. Sites / work / Lighthouse
    1. Propio
    2. Savoir
    3. BetterBankside (soon)
    4. Lighthouse Website (soon)
    5. StemCSS
    ... just choose 4 of those mebbe?
  2. Personal Web Projects / Games / Apps etc.
    1. canvasnake
    2. scrabble (hopefully react soon)
    3. codeheadings
  3. Video games screenshots / gallery (pull from Imgur(?))
3. Footer or links page or in header?

Yellow means link / button
Need build task for JS so... might as well make a build task
4 space tabs
no scss/sass
only classes when reaaally needed.
under 1kB JS
single page with codeheadings and build task to remove them?

Just make each of the below full vw with non-browser-windowed looping mp4

so we need to have a full vh header with some stuff in:
burnt.io
intro text
links to each section
codepen/github/email/twitter

projects on the left, text on the right?
but project screenshots/mp4s have to be the thing that scrolls umm

websites?
 - savoir
 - hlsi
 - lighthouse
 - ... there needs to be a "more" button with a page of all of them?
   - propio
   - betterbankside
projects?
 - stemCSS
 - codeheadings
game-dev?
 - Dioretsa
 - Canvasnake
